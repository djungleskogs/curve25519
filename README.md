This is a Python code I made about Curve25519, It is an elliptic curve used in Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) that provides 128 bits of security with a 256-bit key size, like NIST-P 256. Curve25519 is a Montgomery curve, using projective (X: Z) arithmetic with the Curve equation: y^2=x^3+486662x^2+x over the base field F_p  "with " p=2^255-19 and generator 9, projectivity (9:1).
The Diffie-Hellman function is known as 'X25519' or 'Diffie-Hellman with Curve25519', while the underlying curve is called 'Curve25519'. Curve25519 is a state-of-the-art elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman function that is suitable for a wide variety of cryptographic applications.
